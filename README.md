Covid Data Application

### Technologies Used
<p> Tech 1 - Apache Spark 3.1.2 </p> 
<p> Tech 2 - Spark SQL </p>
<p> Tech 3 - YARN </p>
<p> Tech 4 - Hadoop 3.2 </p>
<p> Tech 5 - SBT 1.5.4  </p>
<p> Tech 6 - Scala 2.11.12  </p>
<p> Tech 7 - Git + GitHub  </p>
<p> Tech 8 - VS Code  </p>

### Features

<p>-This is a Command Line Interface application.</p>
<p>-This is an application which can be used to form an analysis on Covid-19 data.</p>
<p>-We use OOP concepts so that each of our classes are separately pushed to GitHub branches, 
and this helps to identify any possible hang-ups in our program.</p>

### To-do list:

<p> -To compare the rate of increase of infection rate for other time intervals in addition to the time intervals already analyzed </p>
<p> -To find more correlations such as how vaccination rates may affect infection rates </p>

### Getting Started

- git clone https://github.com/leifriggsl/Project2.git

### Images 

<p>-Here are some images from this project.  The image on the left shows the spike in new cases when Covid first hit in the US in March, 2020.</p>
<p> -The image on the right shows a similar shape of graph for both new cases and deaths due to Covid for each month. </p>
